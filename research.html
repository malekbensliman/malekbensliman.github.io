				        <strong>Research Overview:</strong>
				        <br><br>
						My research lies in the application of mathematical and statistical tools to marketing in the area of social networks. Specifically, I use graph theoretical approaches to gain a better understanding of their structures and devise new techniques to generate insights on the behavior of networked consumers. I study how such insights on the diffusion of information and word-of-mouth can be be leveraged, through the design of efficient seeding strategies for instance, by businesses and companies.

						    <li><b>The Extended Directed Friendship Paradox</b><br>Malek Ben Sliman and Rajeev Kohli<br><i>Submitted at <i>Operations Research</i> <br>
				                [<a href="#gppm-abstract" id="1_collapse" onclick="expand_collapse('1');">Show Abstract</a>] [<a href="https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3395317" target="_blank">Paper</a>]</a>   <br>

				                <div id="1" style="display:none;"><blockquote>The friendship paradox says that on average your friends have more friends than you. Equivalently, in an undirected graph, the average degree of the nodes is no greater than the average degree of the terminal node of a random walk of length one. We generalize this result in two ways: (1) by considering directed graphs, which also allow one-sided relations, such as between followers and leaders; and (2) by characterizing the relations between the expected values of the  in and out degrees of the terminal nodes of random alternating walks of length $2k$ and $2k+1$, where $k\ge 0$. The limiting value of these averages is  proportional to the largest singular value of the associated adjacency matrix, and to its largest eigenvalue in the special case of an undirected graph. We interpret the results for one-sided relations (e.g., between leaders and followers) and two-sided relations (e.g., between friends).</blockquote></div></li><br>

						    <li><b>R2M Index 1.0: Assessing the Relevance to Marketing of Academic Marketing Research</b><br>Kamel Jedidi, Bernd Schmitt, Malek Ben Sliman, and Yanyan Li.<br><i>Revision invited at <i>Journal of Marketing</i> <br>
				                [<a href="#gppm-abstract" id="1_collapse" onclick="expand_collapse('1');">Show Abstract</a>] </a>   <br>

				                <div id="1" style="display:none;"><blockquote>Has marketing academia lost its relevance for marketing practice? To move beyond the long-lasting conceptual debate, this article assesses this question empirically by employing a text-mining methodology on academic marketing articles. We develop version 1.0 of the R2M (Relevance to Marketing) Index and validate it against external measures: the index correlates with relevance measures, such as practice awards and practitioner evaluations of articles, and articles in marketing journals have a higher score than articles in disciplinary journals in psychology and economics. Moreover, we find that articles published in the {\it Journal of Marketing} have the highest R2M score followed by {\it Marketing Science}, {\it Journal of Marketing Research}, and {\it Journal of Consumer Research}. We suggest that journal editors and authors use the R2M Index to assess the relevance of an article, and marketing practitioners to identify relevant articles. Because the index will always be a work in progress that requires continuous improvement, we discuss how to overcome limitations by including more journals, designing further safeguards against ``gaming the system,'' and moving from relevance to business impact.</blockquote></div></li><br>

						<strong>Work in Progress:</strong>

				        <li><b>Leveraging the Friendship Paradox for Seeding in Asymmetric Networks</b><br> Malek Ben Sliman and Rajeev Kohli<br>In preparation, to be submitted at <i>Management Science</i>. <br>
				            [<a href="#hgp-abstract" id="2_collapse" onclick="expand_collapse('2');">Show Abstract</a>] [<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3248965" target="_blank">Working Paper</a>]  <br>

				            <div id="2" style="display:none;"><blockquote> The friendship paradox says that your friends have more friends than you. The result assumes that if two people are friends, then each is the other's friend. In social networks like Facebook where this assumption is satisfied, the friendship paradox implies that firms can potentially achieve faster and more widespread diffusion of information by seeding it with the friends of a group of people than with people in the group itself. We generalize the result to allow one-sided (leader/follower) relations and examine the implications for seeding in social networks like Twitter where messages (such as tweets) can be transmitted in only one direction, from leaders to followers. We use the results to compare seeding with (1) leaders, (2) followers, and (3) ``friends,'' a sample of users selected by ignoring the asymmetry in relations. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which each of three seeding methods obtains the highest number of followers per seed. We analyze a subset of Twitter data and find that seeding with leaders performs better than the other two methods.				</blockquote></div></li><br>

				        <li><b>Adaptive Customization</b><br> Rajeev Kohli, Khaled Boughanmi and Malek Ben Sliman<br>In preparation, to be submitted at <i>Marketing Science</i>. <br>
				            [<a href="#hgp-abstract" id="2_collapse" onclick="expand_collapse('2');">Show Abstract</a>]  <br>

				            <div id="2" style="display:none;"><blockquote> To facilitate product search, e-commerce websites often allow online shoppers to screen alternatives by sequentially selecting product features. Such screening provides two types of information about the shopper: an explicit preference for the selected features, and an implicit preference ordering over the  features he/she might subsequent select. We propose a methodology for customizing the feature menu and recommending alternatives each time a shopper uses an additional screening feature. The proposed method assumes that there are segments of consumers, each using a different EBA rule for screening alternatives. Both the segment-membership probability and the probability to using a sequence of one or more of still-available features is updated each time a shopper selects a feature. We use this information to iteratively customize the filtering menu and the recommended products displayed to the shopper. We show how choice data may be used to estimate the model and illustrate its use for customization using data on consumer choices for electronic tablets. Only a few screening steps are needed to identify segment membership. We describe situations in which the seller's profit is maximized by delaying product recommendations until a shopper has screened alternatives using one or more features. We consider how and why the seller should select a single attribute (e.g., brand name) to design a choice task (e.g., which best-selling brand would you like to see?) that provides the most information and maximizes the expected profits for the seller.</blockquote></div></li><br>
