				<p>I am a fifth year Ph.D. Candidate in the <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/marketing" target="_blank">Marketing division</a> at the Graduate School of Business, <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank"> Columbia University</a> (CU). My research lies in the application of econometrics, machine learning and graph theory as well as analytical and empirical modeling tools to generate actionable insights for companies. For instance, I developed graph theoretical results to gain a better understanding of social networks and devised efficient stochastic seeding strategies in large or unobservable networks in order to leverage word-of-mouth and spread information and viral content. Additionally, I focused my dissertation on the drivers of art valuation and on the development of a model to predict future auction results by collecting and analyzing data regarding over 140,000 fine art auctions including the paintings’ images. In particular, I blend deep learning and unsupervised learning techniques, as well as econometrics approaches to assess the visual features, the level of creativity and influence of a painting and the evolution of artists’ reputations impacts on auction prices.

				I was born and raised in Tunisia. I moved to Paris to study Mathematics and Physics at <a href="http://www.louislegrand.org/" target="_blank">Lycée Louis Le Grand</a> and continued on to <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/" target="_blank">École Centrale Paris</a>, where I studied engineering. In my final year at Centrale, I studied at CU as part of a double-degree and graduated with both an M.S. in Operations Research from the <a href="https://ieor.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Industrial Engineering and Operations Research</a> department and an M.S. in Industrial Engineering from École Centrale Paris. During my time in France, I have been awarded an <a href="https://www.aefe.fr/orientation/lenseignement-superieur-en-france/devenir-boursier-excellence-major" target="_blank">Excellence-Major</a> Scholarship by the French Government. More recently, I have received a <a href="https://www.luxuryeducationfoundation.org/lef-scholarship-program" target="_blank">Luxury Education Foundation Award</a> for my work on art valuation and was nominated as an <a href="https://www.ama.org/ama-sheth-foundation-doctoral-consortium/" target="_blank"> AMA-Sheth Foundation Doctoral Consortium Fellow</a> by the Marketing department at CU.

				In addition to my scholarly pursuits, I had also been elected President of the Wine Club of Ecole Centrale Paris, which organizes bi-monthly wine tastings. I also have served as the Vice-President and Co-founder of the Centrale Cricket Club. During my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, watching sports, baking, and tasting spirits and liquor.
