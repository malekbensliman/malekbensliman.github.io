				<p>I am a Ph.D.candidate in the Marketing division at the Graduate School of Business, Columbia University. My research lies in the application of mathematical and statistical tools to marketing in the area of social networks. Specifically, I use graph theoretical approaches to gain a better understanding of their structures and devise new techniques to generate insights on the behavior of networked consumers. I study how such insights on the diffusion of information and word-of-mouth can be be leveraged, through the design of efficient seeding strategies for instance, by businesses and companies.Previously, I graduated from Columbia University with a M.S. in Operations Research in the IEOR department. Prior to arriving at Columbia University, I left Tunisia to study Mathematics and Physics in Paris at Lycée Louis Le Grand and continued onto "École Centrale Paris" where I majored in Industrial Engineering. During my time in France, I have been awarded an Excellence Scolarship by the French Government. Asides from my academic activities, I had also been elected President of the Wine Club of Ecole Centrale Paris which organizes bi-monthly wine tastings. I also have served as the Vice-President and Co-founder of the Centrale Cricket Club. During my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, watching sports, baking, and tasting spirits and liquors. For more about me, please see my <a href="research.html">research</a> and <a href="malek_bensliman_cv.pdf">CV</a>. <br><br>
